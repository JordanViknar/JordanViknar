# Welcome to my profile. 👋

Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile, I'm JordanViknar.

## Main Projects
Up until now, I have been mainly known for my scripts on Roblox, especially because of [T0PCAKE](https://github.com/JordanViknar/T0PCAKE) : it doesn't appear much popular on GitHub because it has been given a repository very late, when its popularity was falling.
As for the others scripts, they are archived [here](https://github.com/JordanViknar/JV-Roblox-Scripts) under the LGPL 3.0 License. Quite a number of them have been shown on YouTube.

Anyways, I went away from the Roblox scene : no longer my taste for my age, and no longer my taste in general.

As of right now, my currently active projects (private and public) are :
- JordBOT Nitro (will be released under MPL 2.0 once enough of it is done)
- [Noiseclapper](https://github.com/JordanViknar/Noiseclapper)
- JordBOT Classic (will be archived privately once JordBOT Nitro is released)
