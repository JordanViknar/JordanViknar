Hi, I'm JordanViknar.
So yeah, I used to many funny YouTube videos, and now I'm doing scripts essentially for Roblox.

Much of the stuff I've isn't hosted on GitHub, but eh, I'll try to put more of it here I suppose.

Anyways, if you're really that curious, I know Lua (obviously), Python, and JavaScript.

You can reach me through my Discord with :

You can also use Twitter if that fits you better. I probably won't respond quickly on any other platform, so you shouldn't try those.
