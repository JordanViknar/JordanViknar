# Welcome to my profile.

Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile, I'm JordanViknar. Grab some coffee if you want, take a seat, make yourself comfortable, whatever...

## Known Languages
- Python
- Lua
- JavaScript (NodeJS)
- C

## Main Projects
Up until now, I have been mainly known for my scripts on Roblox, especially because of [T0PCAKE](https://github.com/JordanViknar/T0PCAKE) : it doesn't appear much popular on GitHub because it has been given a repository very late, when its popularity was falling.
As for the others scripts, they are archived [here](https://github.com/JordanViknar/JV-Roblox-Scripts) under the LGPL 3.0 License. Quite a number of them have been shown on YouTube.
Anyways, I went away from the Roblox scene : no longer my taste for my age, and no longer my taste in general.

## How to reach me :

If you'd like to contact me, the following links are available for you :

| Service | Username |
| ---- | ---- |
| Discord | JordanViknar#9203 |

You can also use Twitter if that fits you better. I probably won't respond quickly on any other platform, so you shouldn't try those.
