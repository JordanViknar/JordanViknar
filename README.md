Hi, I'm JordanViknar.

Much of the stuff I've done isn't hosted on GitHub, but eh, I'll try to put more of it here I suppose.

Anyways, if you're really that curious, I know Lua (obviously), Python, and JavaScript.
Planning to learn Scala in the close future.

You can reach me through my Discord with :

You can also use Twitter if that fits you better. I probably won't respond quickly on any other platform, so you shouldn't try those.
